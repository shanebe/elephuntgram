Notes
-----
To obtain the access token, paste this into your browser:

Now let’s obtain the access token. 
Paste this in your browser(replace client_id with your newly created one):
https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URL&response_type=token

Grant the application access to your images and press OK. 
You will now recieve a 404 page or something similar, that’s ok though, look in the adress bar right after the # sign.
That is your access token!
